      score: 0.95
      basis: "Personal selection by Trump for loyalty; ideological alignment; regular Fox News relationship"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Trump chose Hegseth specifically for loyalty and willingness to implement cultural transformation agenda. Hegseth is fierce Trump defender and was selected over establishment candidates. Trump continues support despite controversies."
      relationship_type: "patron-loyalist"

    NSA:
      score: 0.70
      basis: "Both Trump loyalists with military backgrounds; Signal chat collaboration suggests regular coordination"
      confidence: "medium-high"
      notes: "Michael Waltz and Hegseth both in inner MAGA circle. Waltz has congressional experience that may complement Hegseth's lack of senior leadership. Signal chat incident shows coordination on operations. Likely aligned on China threat and culture war issues."
      relationship_type: "allied-collaborators"

    SecState:
      score: 0.55
      basis: "Both Trump appointees but Rubio more establishment/traditional hawk; potential friction on alliances"
      confidence: "medium"
      notes: "Marco Rubio is traditional Republican hawk who values alliances and institutions. Hegseth more unilateralist and transactional. Both focus on China but Rubio emphasizes diplomacy while Hegseth emphasizes military power. Hegseth's demand for 5% GDP spending may strain Rubio's alliance management. Respectful but not naturally aligned."

      basis: "JD Vance cast tie-breaking vote for confirmation; ideological alignment on culture war"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Vance critical to Hegseth's confirmation (51-50 vote). Both embrace culture war politics and anti-establishment posture. Vance involved in Signal chats with Hegseth on Yemen attacks. Strong mutual support expected."

    CJCS_Dan_Caine:
      score: 0.65
      basis: "Trump's hand-picked replacement for CQ Brown; National Guard background; CIA experience; working relationship with policy disagreements"
      confidence: "medium-high"
      notes: "Gen. Dan Caine confirmed April 2025 as 22nd CJCS after Trump fired CQ Brown (whom Hegseth had criticized as 'woke'). Caine is first National Guard officer to be CJCS, came from CIA associate director role. Trump selected him as 'real general.' Caine and Hegseth have 'dueling approaches' - Caine provides measured military advice while Hegseth focuses on political messaging. Caine has raised concerns directly to Hegseth about changing NDS priorities from China to homeland defense. Professional working relationship with joint briefings but underlying policy tensions. Better than predecessor but not fully aligned."
      relationship_type: "professional-with-tensions"

    CJCS_CQ_Brown_FIRED:
      score: 0.15
      basis: "Hegseth called for Brown's firing; Trump ultimately fired him February 2025"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "HISTORICAL - Gen. Charles Q. Brown was fired February 2025 after Hegseth said 'you've got to fire the Chairman Joint Chiefs' due to DEI support. Hegseth lambasted Brown in 'War on Warriors' book. Initially softened position on first day ('standing with him') but Brown ultimately on list of officers to be removed. Fired and replaced by Dan Caine."

      score: 0.50
      basis: "Mixed - operational commanders focused on warfighting may align, but resistance to cultural purges"
      confidence: "medium"
      notes: "Combatant commanders (INDOPACOM, EUCOM, etc.) may appreciate focus on readiness and China deterrence but wary of politicization and officer purges. Hegseth's combat experience gives credibility but lack of senior leadership raises doubts. Relationship will depend on individual commanders and how disruptive cultural changes prove."

    Service_Chiefs:
      score: 0.40
      basis: "Institutional leaders likely resistant to rapid cultural transformation and officer removals"

      notes: "Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps chiefs responsible for training and readiness. Concerned about Hegseth's plans to overhaul promotion system, fire DEI-supporting officers, and impose cultural litmus tests. May slow-roll implementation while publicly complying. Pentagon bureaucracy typically resistant to political interference."
