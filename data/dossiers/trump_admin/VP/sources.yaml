    rationale: "Extensive public record from 'Hillbilly Elegy' (2016) through VP tenure (2025). Multiple primary sources including official speeches, interviews, and leaked Signal chats showing private deliberations. Senate voting record documented. Munich speech and Iran strikes well-covered. Vance-Rubio relationship confirmed by multiple independent sources. Only 10 months as VP so still developing record, but trajectory clear."

  critical_note: |
    IMPORTANT FOR SYSTEM USERS:

    JD Vance is positioned as Trump's heir apparent for 2028 MAGA leadership.
    This gives him extraordinary influence for a Vice President.

    His closest relationship is with Marco Rubio (SecState / Acting NSA), who he
    consults with daily. Their offices are adjacent and they are each other's
    primary foreign policy advisors within the administration.

    Vance is described as "the most thoroughgoing and consistent America Firster
    in the administration, even more than Trump" per leaked Signal chats.

    His foreign policy philosophy: Restraint + China focus + European burden-sharing
    + working-class economic lens. Exception: willing to use force on Iran nuclear threat.
