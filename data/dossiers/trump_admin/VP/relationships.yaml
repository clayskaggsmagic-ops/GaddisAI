    President:
      score: 0.95
      basis: "Personal selection as VP and designated heir apparent; Trump calls him 'most likely' to carry MAGA mantle in 2028"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Extremely close relationship. Trump values Vance's loyalty (complete conversion from 2016 Never Trump critic), youth, working-class appeal, and ideological commitment to America First. Vance has regular Oval Office access and participates in all major NSC decisions. Trump: 'probably favorite at this point' for 2028. Relationship is patron-protégé with mutual benefit: Trump gets loyal executor, Vance gets path to presidency."
      relationship_type: "patron-heir_apparent"

    SecState_Marco_Rubio:
      score: 0.90
      basis: "Closest friend in administration; daily consultation; offices feet apart in West Wing; described as 'incredibly competent and reliable'"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Vance and Rubio have exceptionally close working relationship. They 'talk every day,' serve as each other's 'primary sounding boards,' and Rubio spends more time at White House than State Department specifically to consult with Vance. Both are positioning for MAGA future (Trump floated Vance-Rubio 2028 ticket as 'unstoppable'). Competitive for future but maintain genuine friendship. Collaborated closely on Iran strikes, Yemen deliberations, and most foreign policy decisions. Generational peers (Vance 40, Rubio 54) with shared Senate experience."

    SecDef_Pete_Hegseth:
      score: 0.85
      basis: "Vance cast tie-breaking vote for Hegseth confirmation; ideological alignment on culture war and America First; regular NSC collaboration"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Vance was essential to Hegseth's confirmation, casting 51-50 tie-breaking vote. Both are culture warriors committed to America First ideology. Both participated in NSC Signal chats together (Yemen, Iran deliberations). Shared commitment to China focus and skepticism of European commitments. Hegseth grateful for Vance's confirmation support. Working relationship is strong but not as close personally as Vance-Rubio. Vance more intellectually oriented, Hegseth more operationally focused."
      relationship_type: "aligned-mutual_support"

    NSA_Acting_Marco_Rubio:
      score: 0.90
      basis: "Same person as SecState; Rubio holds dual role as Acting NSA since May 2025"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Rubio's dual role means Vance's closest friend IS the Acting National Security Advisor. This gives Vance extraordinary influence over NSC process and information flow. They coordinate daily on national security matters."

    CJCS_Dan_Caine:
      score: 0.70
      basis: "Professional working relationship; Caine participated in Iran strikes Situation Room meeting with Vance"
      confidence: "medium"
      notes: "Gen. Dan Caine (22nd CJCS, confirmed April 2025) works professionally with Vance on NSC matters. Caine was present in Situation Room during Iran strikes alongside Vance, Trump, Hegseth, Rubio. Vance likely appreciates that Caine is Trump's hand-picked replacement for CQ Brown. However, Vance's limited military knowledge (2-year Senate stint with no Armed Services Committee experience) may create expertise gap. Respectful but not close."
      relationship_type: "professional-respectful"

    Service_Chiefs:
      score: 0.60
      basis: "Formal relationship; Vance has veteran credibility as Marine Corps Iraq veteran but limited senior military knowledge"
      confidence: "medium"
      notes: "Service chiefs likely appreciate Vance's Marine Corps service (combat correspondent, Iraq 2005-2006) but note his limited exposure to senior defense policy. Vance's foreign policy restraint philosophy and burden-sharing demands may find some support among officers frustrated with endless deployments, but institutional military prefers traditional alliances over Vance's transactionalism."

      confidence: "medium-high"
      notes: "John Ratcliffe (CIA Director) and Vance work together regularly on NSC matters. Ratcliffe was in Situation Room during Iran strikes and participated in Signal chats that included Vance. Both are committed Trump loyalists. Ratcliffe's intelligence assessments inform Vance's policy advice. Professional and aligned relationship."

      confidence: "medium"
      notes: "Tulsi Gabbard (Director of National Intelligence) shares Vance's skepticism of foreign intervention. Both opposed endless Middle East wars, though Gabbard's past Syria positions are more controversial. Gabbard participated in Iran strikes Situation Room meeting and Signal chats with Vance. Ideological alignment on restraint but Vance more establishment MAGA than Gabbard's idiosyncratic positions."

      basis: "Ideological soulmate; both economic nationalists and foreign policy restrainers; Senate colleagues"
      relationship: "Hawley (R-MO) and Vance were Senate colleagues with nearly identical worldviews. Both are young (Hawley 45), Yale Law graduates, economic nationalists, China hawks, and intervention skeptics. Hawley defended Vance during VP campaign. Natural allies on trade, tech, and foreign policy."

    - name: "Marco Rubio"

      basis: "Former Senate colleague; now closest friend in administration as SecState/Acting NSA"
      relationship: "Rubio was Vance's Senate colleague (Vance 2023-2025, Rubio since 2011). Rubio mentored Vance on foreign policy. Relationship deepened in Trump administration where they consult daily. Vance looks to Rubio for foreign policy expertise; Rubio values Vance's Trump access."

    - name: "Tom Cotton"
      chamber: "Senate"
      score: 0.70
      basis: "Both military veterans and China hawks; Cotton more interventionist than Vance"
      relationship: "Cotton (R-AR, Army veteran, SASC member) shares Vance's China hawkishness but is more interventionist overall. Cotton supported Hegseth confirmation (Vance cast tie-breaker). Both military veterans but different foreign policy philosophies - Cotton more traditional hawk, Vance more restraint-oriented. Respectful but not fully aligned."

    - name: "Rand Paul"
      chamber: "Senate"
      score: 0.75
      basis: "Both intervention skeptics and burden-sharing advocates; Paul more libertarian, Vance more nationalist"
      relationship: "Paul (R-KY) and Vance share skepticism of foreign intervention and NATO burden-sharing. Both opposed Ukraine aid. However, Paul is libertarian while Vance is economic nationalist - different philosophical foundations for similar positions. Tactical allies on restraint, not ideological soulmates."

      basis: "Graham is interventionist hawk; opposes Vance's restraint philosophy and burden-sharing demands"
      relationship: "Graham (R-SC) represents traditional Republican interventionism that Vance opposes.

      chamber: "House"
      score: 0.15
      basis: "HASC Ranking Member; opposes Vance's NATO skepticism and China-only focus"
      relationship: "Smith (D-WA, HASC Ranking Member) is progressive on defense issues and strongly supports Ukraine aid, NATO, and multilateralism - all positions Vance critiques. Smith views Vance's Munich speech as damaging to alliances. Fundamental policy disagreements."

      basis: "HFAC Chair supports Ukraine aid and traditional alliances; skeptical of Vance's Europe comments"

      confidence: "high"
      relationship: "European leaders were stunned by Vance's February 14, 2025 Munich Security Conference speech. German Defense Minister Pistorius said comparisons to authoritarianism were 'not acceptable.' Vance's burden-sharing demands and criticism of EU censorship policies created deep rift. European diplomats described 'room full of people with their mouth open.' Relationship is cold and transactional."

      basis: "Appreciate China focus but concerned about burden-sharing demands and alliance reliability"
      confidence: "medium"
      relationship: "Japanese leaders welcome Vance's China prioritization but worry about his transactional approach to alliances and demands for increased defense spending.

      confidence: "medium"
      relationship: "South Korea appreciates focus on China and North Korea threats but nervous about Vance's burden-sharing demands. ROK already hosts substantial US forces and pays significant host nation support. Vance's transactional approach and limited Korea experience create uncertainty."

      basis: "Strong alignment on China threat; AUKUS partnership; Five Eyes intelligence sharing"
      confidence: "medium-high"
      relationship: "Australia is Vance's closest international relationship. AUKUS (Australia-UK-US submarine deal) aligns with Vance's China focus. Australia already pulls weight in alliance (2% GDP+ on defense). Shared Five Eyes intelligence cooperation. Australian leaders appreciate Vance's Indo-Pacific prioritization. Less burden-sharing tension than with Europe."

      confidence: "high"
      relationship: "Israeli leaders appreciate Vance's strong support for Israel military aid and his willingness to strike Iran nuclear facilities. Vance's presence in Situation Room during Iran strikes signaled commitment. However, Vance's general restraint philosophy and working-class economic focus may limit blank check support long-term."

    - name: "Ukraine (Zelenskyy)"

      basis: "Vance opposed Ukraine aid; stated 'I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another'"
      confidence: "very_high"
      relationship: "Vance has terrible relationship with Ukraine. His opposition to aid, advocacy for territorial concessions to Russia, and focus on China over Europe have made him persona non grata in Kyiv. Zelenskyy views Vance as representing end of US support. No trust or goodwill."

      score: 0.15
      basis: "Hostile after Munich speech; view Vance as threat to transatlantic relationship"

      basis: "Appreciate China focus and modernization but uncertain about reduced Europe commitments"
      relationship: "Defense contractors welcome Vance's China prioritization (drives shipbuilding, missiles, Indo-Pacific posture) but concerned his Europe withdrawal could reduce overall spending. Relationship is transactional - support policies that drive revenue."
