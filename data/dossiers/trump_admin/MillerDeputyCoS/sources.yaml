  confidence_assessment:
    overall_confidence: "very_high"
    rationale: |
      Extensive public record from Duke University (2003) through second Trump administration
      (2025). Miller is one of most well-documented Trump advisors due to:

      1. Long public career (Duke activism → Sessions staffer → Trump campaign → two WH terms)
      2. Controversial policies generating extensive coverage (Muslim ban, family separation, DEI elimination)
      3. SPLC extremist designation with 900+ leaked emails
      4. Multiple investigative reports on his influence
      5. Official government documents (executive orders he drafted)
      6. Contemporary reporting on his expanding power in 2025

      Primary sources include executive orders Miller drafted and official White House materials.
      Secondary sources are numerous and converge on consistent portrait: most influential
      advisor after Trump, immigration hardliner, ideological enforcer, expanding into foreign
      policy via counter-drug operations.

      Only uncertainty is future role (will he become permanent NSA?), but current influence
      is extremely well-documented.

  key_findings:
    most_important_sources:
      - "CNN's comprehensive analysis of Miller's offensive on Democratic cities and counter-drug operations"
      - "NBC's analysis calling Miller 'untouchable force' and 'the prime minister'"
      - "Axios scoops on Miller as NSA contender and ICE pressure"
      - "Executive Order 14151 (Miller's DEI termination order)"
      - "SPLC extremist file with leaked email evidence"
      - "NPR on Miller's HSA role and NSC elevation"

    source_gaps:
      - "Limited primary sources (Miller rarely gives interviews to non-conservative media)"
      - "No access to internal White House deliberations beyond leaks"
      - "Miller's personal views on China policy not extensively documented"
      - "Details of Miller-Trump private conversations are inferred not documented"

  areas_of_strength:
    - "Immigration policy positions exhaustively documented"
    - "DEI executive orders are primary source material"
    - "Influence mechanisms well-analyzed by multiple independent sources"
    - "Duke University activism documented by Duke Chronicle"
    - "Jeff Sessions mentorship confirmed by multiple sources"
    - "Gang of Eight killing (2013) well-documented legislative battle"
    - "Family separation and Muslim ban extensively covered"
    - "SPLC emails provide rare window into ideological formation"
    - "Counter-drug operations with Rubio confirmed by multiple sources"
    - "Override authority over Vance documented"

  areas_of_weakness:
    - "Miller's specific China policy positions less documented than immigration"
    - "Details of America First Legal Foundation activities (2021-2024) incomplete"
    - "Miller's views on specific foreign policy beyond sovereignty rhetoric not fully developed"
    - "Personal life largely private (wife Katie Waldman but children details scarce)"
    - "Future political ambitions unclear (no evidence he wants elected office)"

  update_recommendations:
    - "Monitor if Miller becomes permanent NSA (major development)"
    - "Track mass deportation numbers vs 1 million goal (quarterly)"
    - "Document additional executive orders Miller drafts (ongoing)"
    - "Follow counter-drug operations he leads with Rubio (as occur)"
    - "Track legal challenges to Miller policies (ACLU, others)"
    - "Update relationships if Cabinet changes occur"

  critical_assessment: |
    IMPORTANCE FOR NSC SIMULATION:

    Stephen Miller is arguably the SECOND most important person in Trump administration
    after Trump himself. He is:

    1. "Trump's brain" - translates Trump's instincts into policy
    2. "The prime minister" - most influential White House official
    3. Deputy CoS for Policy - controls White House policy process
    4. Homeland Security Advisor - leads HSC (elevated to NSC-equivalent)
    5. Potential future NSA - Trump said he "indirectly already has" the job

    For GaddisAI NSC simulation, Miller is critical because:

    - He can OVERRIDE VP Vance on policy decisions
    - He LEADS counter-drug military operations (not SecDef Hegseth)
    - He COORDINATES Cabinet (Noem, Bondi, Hegseth, Rubio)
    - He has DIRECT Trump access (closest advisor)
    - Immigration/homeland security is now NATIONAL SECURITY priority (HSC = NSC)

    Miller's immigration focus affects NSC matters:
    - Border/Mexico policy
    - Central America relations
    - Military use for counter-drug (Caribbean strikes)
    - Alliance relationships (damaged by nationalism)
    - International organization participation (WHO, G-7)

    ANY NSC scenario involving:
    - Immigration/border
    - Latin America
    - Drug cartels
    - Sovereignty vs multilateralism
    - Federal power vs states
    - DEI in military

    ...Miller will be primary voice, potentially overriding traditional NSC principals.
