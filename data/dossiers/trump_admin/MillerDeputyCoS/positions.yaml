  confidence_level: "very_high"

  notable_patterns: |
    Miller's positions are remarkably consistent and ideologically coherent. Everything flows from
    core nationalism: immigration is existential threat, sovereignty cannot be constrained,
    international institutions undermine America, diversity programs weaken national unity,
    courts blocking Trump are illegitimate.

    Unlike other Trump advisors who have complex or evolving positions, Miller has simple,
    absolute convictions executed with maximum aggression.

  evolution: |
    Miller's positions have NOT evolved - they have intensified. From Jeff Sessions staffer (2009)
    to present (2025), his immigration restrictionism has only become more extreme. The difference
    in second Trump term is he now has more power to implement his vision.

    First term: Fought within administration against moderates (Kelly, Mattis, Tillerson)
    Second term: No moderates to fight; Miller has uncontested ideological control

  implementation_approach: |
    Miller doesn't just hold positions - he implements them through:
    - Executive orders (drafted dozens in first weeks of second term)
    - Federal law enforcement deployment
    - Cabinet coordination (DHS, DOJ, DoD)
    - Legal warfare (America First Legal Foundation)
    - Ideological vetting of personnel
    - Public attacks on opposition (courts, Democrats, media)

  foreign_policy_relevance: |
    While Miller's focus is domestic (immigration, DEI), his positions affect NSC matters:

    1. IMMIGRATION AS NATIONAL SECURITY: Elevating HSC to NSC-equivalent status means
       immigration gets same priority as traditional foreign policy

    2. ALLIANCE SKEPTICISM: NATO Article 5 removal, sovereignty rhetoric undermines
       traditional alliances

    3. COUNTER-DRUG OPERATIONS: Leading military strikes in Caribbean with Rubio,
       not Hegseth - homeland security-foreign policy nexus

    4. INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS: WHO withdrawal, G-7 migration blocking affects
       US multilateral engagement

    5. OVERRIDE AUTHORITY: Miller "overrode Vance and others" on Yemen strikes,
       showing he influences NSC beyond his portfolio when immigration/border connected

  controversial_aspects: |
    - SPLC lists Miller as extremist
    - Family separation widely condemned
    - Muslim ban faced legal challenges
    - DEI elimination criticized as rolling back civil rights
    - Attacks on judiciary undermine rule of law
    - Mass deportations raise humanitarian concerns

    Miller is arguably the most controversial figure in Trump administration, yet also
    the most influential after Trump himself.
