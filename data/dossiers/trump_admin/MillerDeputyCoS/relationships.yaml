  # NSC/WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPALS
  within_administration:
    President:
      score: 1.0
      basis: "Closest advisor to Trump; called 'Trump's brain' and 'the prime minister'; longest-serving advisor since 2016 campaign"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Miller has 'accumulated more influence than any other White House official outside Trump.' He is Trump's ideological enforcer and policy translator - has 'canny ability to translate Trump's policy ideas into action.' Miller has direct access to Trump, bypassing normal White House channels. Trump stated Miller 'indirectly already has' the NSA job and is 'at the top of the totem pole' for permanent appointment. Relationship is patron-loyalist: Trump trusts Miller's ideology and implementation skills; Miller is absolutely loyal and never wavers."
      relationship_type: "patron-closest_advisor"

    VP_JD_Vance:
      score: 0.70
      basis: "Miller can override Vance on policy decisions; Miller has more day-to-day influence despite Vance being VP"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Miller 'basically overrode Vance and others during a debate about strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.' This shows Miller has more operational authority than VP on issues he prioritizes. Both are culture warriors and ideologically aligned on America First, but Miller is Trump's implementer while Vance is heir apparent. Miller focuses on domestic/immigration policy; Vance on foreign policy. Respectful relationship but Miller is senior in influence hierarchy. Vance was involved in Miller's selection (confirmed appointment in Nov 2024)."

      basis: "Close collaboration on counter-drug operations and immigration; 'Marco and Stephen have worked really closely on immigration'"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Miller and Rubio have developed surprisingly close working relationship given Rubio was Gang of Eight (amnesty) sponsor in 2013 and Miller killed that bill. Both have moved to hardline Trump position. They co-lead counter-drug mission with lethal strikes in Caribbean. White House source: 'Marco and Stephen have worked really closely on immigration and it might be a perfect match.' Both live in military housing ('Trump Green Zone'). Rubio provides foreign policy expertise; Miller provides Trump access and domestic implementation. Mutual benefit relationship."

      score: 0.85
      basis: "Same person as SecState; Rubio holds dual role"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Rubio's dual role means Miller's immigration/homeland security focus directly interfaces with NSC. Miller leads HSC which 'convenes on topics agreed to in advance by the National Security Advisor and the Homeland Security Advisor.' Miller and Rubio coordinate on issues spanning foreign-domestic nexus (cartels, migration, border)."

      basis: "Miller coordinates regularly with Hegseth but Miller leads on military use for counter-drug operations"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Miller 'regularly coordinates' with Defense Secretary Hegseth. However, 'it was Miller, not Hegseth, who led the internal push to use the military to target drug cartels.' Miller and Rubio are 'far more involved than Hegseth in deciding how the military is used' for counter-drug operations. Both are culture warriors (DEI elimination, 'woke' military concerns). Hegseth respects Miller's Trump access and ideological purity. Both live in military housing. Miller directs, Hegseth implements on drug/immigration operations."

      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "As Homeland Security Advisor, Miller has direct coordination authority over DHS. 'Miller regularly coordinates with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem' per multiple sources. Miller and Noem jointly pressured ICE to triple arrest numbers for mass deportations. Both live in military housing ('Trump Green Zone'). Noem implements Miller's immigration vision. Miller drafted executive orders, Noem executes. Very close working relationship with clear hierarchy - Miller sets policy, Noem implements."

      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Miller 'regularly coordinates' with Attorney General Pam Bondi. DOJ is critical for immigration enforcement (prosecutions, detention, litigation). Bondi's DOJ provides legal cover for Miller's executive orders. Both focused on federal power assertion over resistant states. Miller's America First Legal Foundation (which he founded) coordinate with DOJ on legal strategy. Bondi is Trump loyalist like Miller."

      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Miller's formal reporting line is to Chief of Staff, but in practice he has independent Trump access. As 'the prime minister,' Miller operates with autonomy. CoS must manage Miller's aggressive tactics while recognizing his closeness to Trump. Miller's dual role (Deputy CoS for Policy + HSA) gives him portfolio broader than typical deputy. Cooperative but Miller is semi-independent power center."

      relationship: "Miller worked for Sessions 2009-2016 as Communications Director. Sessions was Miller's political mentor who introduced him to anti-immigration think tanks (FAIR, NumbersUSA, CIS) and taught him legislative tactics. Together they killed Gang of Eight immigration bill (2013). Sessions later became Trump's first Attorney General (2017-2018) before being fired.

relationship_dynamics:
  trump_dependency: |
    All of Miller's power flows from Trump relationship. Miller has no independent political
    base, no public constituency, no elected position. He is pure Trump loyalist and policy
    implementer. If Trump turned on Miller (unlikely), Miller would lose all influence instantly.

    But Trump won't turn on Miller because Miller is:
    1. Absolutely loyal (never leaked, never wavered)
    2. Ideologically pure (truest America First believer)
    3. Effective implementer (turns Trump's instincts into executive orders)
    4. Longest-serving advisor (2016 campaign to present)

    Miller has made himself indispensable.

  cabinet_coordinator_not_member: |
    Miller is not Cabinet member but coordinates Cabinet on his priorities. As Deputy CoS
    for Policy + HSA, he has formal coordination authority. Cabinet secretaries (Noem,
    Bondi, Hegseth, Rubio) must work with Miller on policy implementation.

    This gives Miller more influence than many Cabinet members because he controls White
    House policy process and has Trump's ear.

  override_authority: |
    Miller can "override" even the Vice President (Vance) on policy debates. This is
    extraordinary. Shows Miller's unique position - not formal hierarchy but Trump's
    trust gives him effective veto on issues he prioritizes.

    Miller's override authority applies when he sees immigration/homeland security connection.
    He "led the internal push" on counter-drug military operations, not SecDef Hegseth.

  rubio_partnership_irony: |
    Miller destroyed Marco Rubio's Gang of Eight amnesty bill in 2013. Rubio was then
    immigration moderate, Miller was hardline restrictionist.

    Now (2025) they are close partners. Both have moved to Trump's position. They co-lead
    counter-drug operations, both live in military housing, coordinate daily on immigration.

    Shows how Trump has remade Republican Party - Rubio abandoned Gang of Eight position,
    adopted Miller's vision. Miller forgave Rubio's past because Rubio is loyal MAGA now.

  mentor_to_enforcer: |
    Jeff Sessions (mentor) taught Miller immigration restrictionism in Senate (2009-2016).
    Sessions later became Trump's first Attorney General (2017-2018).
    Trump fired Sessions (2018) for recusing from Russia investigation.

    Miller remained loyal to Sessions' vision but not to Sessions personally when loyalty
    to Trump conflicted. Shows Miller prioritizes ideology and Trump, not personal loyalty.

  institutional_opposition: |
    Miller faces consistent opposition from:
    - Federal courts (block his executive orders)
    - State/local governments (resist immigration enforcement)
    - Civil rights organizations (sue his policies)
    - Mainstream media (critical coverage)
    - European allies (oppose his nationalism)

    Miller doesn't try to win over opposition - he attacks them as illegitimate:
    - Courts are "judicial coup"
    - Democrats prioritize foreigners
    - SPLC is discredited
    - Media is fake news

    Pure combat approach, no consensus-building.
