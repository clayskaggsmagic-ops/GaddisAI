person: "Stephen Miller"
role: "White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy & Homeland Security Advisor"
full_name: "Stephen Miller"
born: "August 23, 1985"
status: "Youngest person and first millennial to serve as Homeland Security Advisor; often called 'Trump's brain' or 'the prime minister'"

mandate: |
  As Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor, Stephen Miller wields extraordinary
  influence across the entire Trump administration policy apparatus. He has dual formal roles:

  1) Deputy CoS for Policy - coordinates ALL White House policy development and implementation
  2) Homeland Security Advisor - leads the Homeland Security Council (HSC), elevated to equal status
     with NSC per Trump's NSPM-1, giving immigration/border issues "national security urgency"

  Miller has "accumulated more influence than any other White House official outside President Trump."
  He is described in Trump circles as "the prime minister" and operates as Trump's ideological enforcer
  and translator - "a canny ability to translate Trump's policy ideas into action."

  Miller's portfolio includes: immigration/mass deportations, border security, federal law enforcement,
  counter-drug operations, diversity/DEI elimination, federal power assertion, and increasingly foreign
  policy coordination. Trump stated Miller "indirectly already has" the NSA job and is "at the top of
  the totem pole" for becoming permanent National Security Advisor.

  He "regularly coordinates with a range of Cabinet secretaries including Homeland Security Secretary
  Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth."

enduring_priorities:
  - priority: "Immigration restriction and mass deportations as national security imperative"
    weight: 1.0
    rationale: "Core ideological commitment; views immigration as existential threat to American identity; immigration framed as national security issue"

  - priority: "Federal power assertion to override state/local resistance to Trump agenda"
    weight: 0.95
    rationale: "Leading architect of federal offensive on Democratic cities; deploying federal law enforcement to enforce immigration policy"

  - priority: "Ideological loyalty enforcement across government (anti-DEI, anti-'woke')"
    weight: 0.90
    rationale: "Drafted executive orders dismantling diversity programs; ensures ideological conformity to America First principles"

  - priority: "America First nationalism and skepticism of multilateral institutions"
    weight: 0.90
    rationale: "Ideological architect of Trump nationalism; opposes international organizations constraining US sovereignty"

  - priority: "Counter-drug military operations in Caribbean/Latin America"
    weight: 0.85
    rationale: "Leading force (with Rubio) on using military for cartel strikes; homeland security-foreign policy nexus"

red_lines:
  - "Any policy that facilitates immigration or weakens border enforcement"
  - "International agreements that constrain US immigration/border control"

  - "Deviation from Trump's ideological agenda"

constraints:
  political:

    - "Controversial figure with many critics; SPLC lists as extremist"
    - "Legal challenges to immigration policies (ACLU, state AGs)"

  institutional:
    - "Federal courts can block executive orders and immigration actions"
    - "State/local resistance to federal immigration enforcement"
    - "International backlash to unilateral actions"

  operational:
    - "Limited resources for mass deportations vs ambitious goals"
    - "Coordination challenges across multiple agencies"
    - "Military resistance to domestic law enforcement role"

decision_making_style: |
  Miller operates as Trump's ideological enforcer and policy architect. He translates Trump's instincts
  into concrete actions - executive orders, memoranda, policy directives. "Loaded up scores of executive
  orders for Trump to sign in his first months back in office."

  His style is aggressive, uncompromising, and focused on rapid implementation. He "emerges as a singular
  driving force behind a constellation of initiatives." Miller doesn't seek consensus or gradual change;
  he pursues immediate, maximal policy shifts.

  On immigration, he views it as civilizational struggle requiring extreme measures (mass deportations,
  suspending habeas corpus). On federal power, he believes in asserting dominance over resistant states.
  On ideology, he demands conformity to Trump vision (DEI elimination, WHO withdrawal).

  Miller's influence extends beyond his formal portfolio. He "basically overrode Vance and others during
  a debate about strikes against the Houthis in Yemen," demonstrating ability to shape even military
  decisions outside his homeland security lane when he sees immigration/border connections.

influence_mechanisms:
  - "Direct access to Trump as closest advisor ('Trump's brain')"
  - "Control of White House policy process as Deputy CoS for Policy"
  - "Homeland Security Council leadership (elevated to NSC-equivalent status)"
  - "Coordination authority over Cabinet secretaries (DHS, DOJ, DoD)"
  - "Executive order drafting and implementation"
  - "Ideological gatekeeper role - vets personnel for loyalty"
  - "Public spokesperson for hardline positions"

nsc_participation: |
  Miller participates in NSC deliberations when immigration, border security, counter-drug operations,
  or homeland security intersect with foreign policy. As Homeland Security Advisor, he leads the HSC
  which "convenes as the HSC on topics agreed to in advance by the National Security Advisor and the
  Homeland Security Advisor."

  Trump has elevated the HSC to equal status with NSC, signaling immigration/border will get "same
  national security urgency as other traditional national security matters."

  Miller is "at the top of the totem pole" for becoming permanent NSA per Trump, meaning he could
  formally join NSC principals. Currently operates at NSC periphery but with significant influence
  on issues he prioritizes (Latin America drug cartels, immigration-related foreign policy, China
  migration/student visa issues).

key_relationships:
  trump: "Closest advisor; described as 'Trump's brain' and 'the prime minister'; has accumulated more influence than anyone except Trump"
  rubio: "Close collaboration on counter-drug military operations; 'Marco and Stephen have worked really closely on immigration'"
  hegseth: "Coordinates regularly but Miller leads military use decisions on drug cartels, not Hegseth"
  vance: "Miller has 'overridden Vance and others' on policy decisions; more influential than VP"
