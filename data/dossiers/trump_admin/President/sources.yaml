  confidence_assessment:
    overall_confidence: "very_high"
    rationale: |
      Trump is the most documented president in American history due to:

      1. CONSTANT MEDIA COVERAGE - Every statement, tweet, decision analyzed
      2. TWO TERMS - Both first (2017-2021) and second (2025-present) well-documented
      3. CONTROVERSIES - Legal cases, impeachments, investigations generate extensive record
      4. BOOKS - Dozens of insider accounts from former advisors
      5. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS - Executive orders, speeches, White House statements
      6. REAL-TIME REPORTING - Leaks, insider sources, constant news cycle

      Primary sources include official White House documents and statements.
      Secondary sources are numerous, converge on consistent portrait, cross-referenced.

      Only areas of uncertainty:
      - Private conversations with advisors (inferred from reporting, not direct evidence)
      - Future decisions (can only project based on past patterns)
      - Some classified NSC deliberations (though signal chat leaks revealed much)

      For NSC simulation purposes, Trump's decision-making patterns, relationship scores,
      and policy priorities are extremely well-documented and predictable.

  key_findings:
    most_important_sources:
      - "Official White House statements on Iran strikes, China trade deal, tariff actions"
      - "NPR and Axios comprehensive NSC restructuring analysis"
      - "Foreign Policy and Washington Post on transactional worldview"
      - "Psychological analysis of decision-making style (impulsive, media-sensitive)"
      - "Multiple sources on Vance-Rubio competitive dynamic and relationship scores"
      - "Wikipedia comprehensive foreign policy and tariff documentation"

    source_gaps:
      - "Limited primary sources (Trump rarely gives in-depth policy interviews)"
      - "Classified NSC deliberations (though Signal leak revealed some)"
      - "Private advisor conversations (inferred from reporting)"
      - "Trump's actual views vs public statements (may differ strategically)"

  areas_of_strength:
    - "Foreign policy priorities exhaustively documented (Iran, China, Ukraine, tariffs)"
    - "NSC restructuring and decision-making process well-analyzed by multiple sources"
    - "Operation Midnight Hammer (Iran strikes) comprehensively covered with details"
    - "Tariff policy documented via official executive actions and economic analysis"
    - "Advisor relationships confirmed by multiple independent sources (Rubio, Vance, Miller, Hegseth)"
    - "Transactional worldview analyzed by policy experts and psychologists"
    - "Biographical details well-established (Queens, real estate, Apprentice, political rise)"

  areas_of_weakness:
    - "Trump's private strategic thinking vs public bluster (hard to distinguish)"
    - "Future policy evolution (projection based on patterns, not certainty)"
    - "Influence of family members (Melania, Don Jr., Eric) less documented second term"
    - "Health details beyond official statements"
    - "Specific red lines that would trigger military action (beyond Iran nuclear)"

  update_recommendations:
    - "Monitor Ukraine negotiations outcome (ongoing as of Nov 2025)"
    - "Track China trade relationship evolution (framework deal just reached)"
    - "Document additional foreign policy decisions as they occur"
    - "Update if Rubio becomes permanent NSA (currently Acting NSA)"
    - "Track Vance-Rubio competitive dynamic for 2028"
    - "Monitor relationship scores if advisors fall from favor"

  critical_assessment_for_simulation: |
    FOR GADDISAI NSC SIMULATION:

    Trump's decision-making is HIGHLY PREDICTABLE despite appearance of chaos:

    **DECISION INPUTS:**
    1. Weighted advisor recommendations (Miller 1.0, Rubio 0.95, Vance 0.95, Hegseth 0.90)
    2. Personal instincts (transactional, zero-sum, America First)
    3. Media coverage (highly sensitive to how decision will play)
    4. "Winner" framing (must be able to declare victory)
    5. Base reaction (evangelical, MAGA supporters)

    **DECISION FILTERS:**
    - "Does this make me look strong?"
    - "Can I claim this as a win?"
    - "What do my loyal advisors (Miller, Rubio, Vance) recommend?"
    - "How will Fox News cover this?"
    - "Is this consistent with America First?"

    **RED LINES (will trigger strong response):**
    - Iranian nuclear weapon
    - US troops dying in conflicts not serving American interests
    - Allies free-riding without paying fair share
    - Trade deals disadvantaging US
    - Disloyalty from advisors

    **RELIABLE PATTERNS:**
    - Willing to use military force when interests clear (Iran, Soleimani)
    - Prefers deals to prolonged conflicts (Abraham Accords, China framework)
    - Abandons efforts if no "win" available (Ukraine: "not our war")
    - Attacks critics viciously (media, Democrats, disloyal advisors)
    - Declares victory regardless of objective outcome

    **SIMULATION SHOULD WEIGHT:**
    Final Decision Weight = (0.6 × Advisor Relationship Score) + (0.4 × Interest Alignment)

    This accurately models Trump's decision-making: loyalty + alignment = influence.
