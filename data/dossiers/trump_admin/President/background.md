### First-Term Internal Battles

Trump's first term was defined by **constant staff turnover** and battles with moderates:

**National Security Advisors:**
1. **Michael Flynn** (23 days) - fired for lying about Russian contacts
2. **H.R. McMaster** (13 months) - traditional general, clashed with Trump
3. **John Bolton** (17 months) - hawk, wanted Iran war, Trump fired him
4. **Robert O'Brien** (rest of term) - more compliant

**Secretaries of State:**
1. **Rex Tillerson** (14 months) - called Trump "fucking moron," fired via tweet
2. **Mike Pompeo** (rest of term) - loyalist, survived

**Secretaries of Defense:**
1. **James Mattis** (2 years) - "Mad Dog," resigned over Syria withdrawal, criticized Trump
2. **Mark Esper** (18 months) - fired for opposing military domestic use

**Pattern**: Trump wanted loyalists. Moderates who constrained him were fired or resigned. By 2020, mostly loyalists remained.

## Second Presidential Term (2025-Present)

### Day One Blitz (January 20, 2025)

Trump came prepared (unlike 2017). Stephen Miller had **scores of executive orders** ready:

- **National emergency** at southern border
- **DEI termination** (Executive Order 14151)
- **WHO withdrawal** initiated
- **Paris accord** exit
- **Immigration enforcement** surge
- **Dozens of other orders**

**Lesson learned from first term**: Come in with plan, execute immediately, use loyalists only.

### Personnel Strategy: Loyalty Over Expertise

**Cabinet Picks Prioritize Loyalty:**

- **Marco Rubio** (SecState) - former rival, now loyalist, "has answers"
- **Pete Hegseth** (SecDef) - Fox News host, culture warrior, not traditional defense expert
- **JD Vance** (VP) - heir apparent, convert from Never Trump to MAGA
- **Stephen Miller** (Deputy CoS) - longest-serving advisor, ideological soulmate
- **Kristi Noem** (DHS) - loyalist implementing Miller's vision
- **Pam Bondi** (AG) - Florida AG, Trump defender

**No moderates**. Everyone is MAGA loyalist. No Mattis, no Kelly, no McMaster to constrain.

### NSC Restructuring

**"NSC as we know it is done":**

- **Shrunken NSC** - traditional staff reduced
- **Rubio dual role** - SecState AND Acting NSA (like Kissinger)
- **Miller's HSC elevated** to NSC-equivalent status
- **Decisions flow from Trump down**, not up through interagency
- **Small group** (Rubio, Vance, Miller, Hegseth) makes decisions
- **Signal chats** for coordination (later leaked, causing scandal)

### Major Second-Term Actions

- Proposed: frozen front lines, Russia keeps seized territory, Crimea recognized as Russian
