  notable_patterns: |
    Trump's positions are remarkably consistent from first term (2017-2021) through second term (2025).
    Core themes:
    1. TRANSACTIONALISM - Every relationship is a deal with winners/losers
    2. NATIONALISM - America First over multilateral cooperation
    3. STRENGTH + DEALS - Willing to use force but prefers negotiated outcomes
    4. LOYALTY - Advisors must be absolutely loyal, no dissent tolerated
    5. ECONOMIC FOCUS - Trade, tariffs, deficits viewed through national security lens

    Second term differences:
    - More systematic implementation (Miller's prepared playbook)
    - No moderates to constrain (first term had Kelly, Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster)
    - Loyalist team executing vision without hesitation
    - Bolder actions (Iran nuclear strikes, massive tariff escalation)

  evolution: |
    Trump's core positions haven't evolved - they've intensified. Lessons learned from first term:

    FIRST TERM (2017-2021):
    - Improvisational, chaotic
    - Moderates constraining impulses
    - Incomplete wall, incomplete immigration agenda
    - Tariffs but no systematic reciprocal framework
    - Iran pressure but no military strikes on nuclear facilities

    SECOND TERM (2025):
    - Systematic, planned (Miller's executive orders ready Day 1)
    - Only loyalists in positions of power
    - Mass deportations, emergency declarations
    - Comprehensive reciprocal tariff framework
    - Iran nuclear facility strikes (Operation Midnight Hammer)

    The ideology is the same. The execution is more effective.

  critical_assessment: |
    Trump's foreign policy represents fundamental break from post-WWII US grand strategy:

    TRADITIONAL US APPROACH:
    - Alliances based on shared values and collective security
    - Multilateral institutions to manage global order
    - Trade liberalization for economic growth and alliance cohesion
    - Long-term strategic partnerships over transactional deals

    TRUMP APPROACH:
    - Alliances are cost-benefit transactions
    - International institutions constrain US sovereignty
    - Trade deficits are exploitation requiring tariff retaliation
    - Every interaction is negotiation with winners and losers

    Whether this represents:
    - Necessary correction to US overextension and free-riding allies, OR
    - Dangerous abandonment of liberal international order and alliance structures

    ...depends on one's perspective. What's clear: Trump has remade Republican Party in his image.
    The GOP is now America First, nationalist, protectionist, alliance-skeptical party.
