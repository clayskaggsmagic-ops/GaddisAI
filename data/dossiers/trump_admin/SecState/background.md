- **Latin America bias** (may over-prioritize vs global threats)

- **Ukraine flip-flop** (damages credibility with some allies)
- **No executive experience** (legislator background, not management)

## Assessment

Marco Rubio represents a unique synthesis of traditional Republican foreign policy and Trump's America First nationalism. Unlike pure Trumpists, he maintains institutional knowledge, alliance relationships, and policy depth. Unlike neoconservatives, he's adopted pragmatism on conflicts (Ukraine) and transactionalism on alliances.

His Cuban-American heritage drives genuine passion on Latin America policy, potentially at expense of other regions. His China hawkishness is sincere and sophisticated, not just political positioning.

The dual SecState/NSA role concentrates enormous power, potentially creating policy coherence but also workload challenges and marginalization of career diplomats.

Rubio's evolution from Trump critic to loyalist reflects broader Republican Party transformation. His unanimous confirmation suggests he's acceptable to establishment while satisfying MAGA base - rare combination in Trump administration.
