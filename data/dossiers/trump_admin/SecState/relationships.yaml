    President:
      score: 0.85
      basis: "Evolved from 2016 rival to trusted ally; unanimous confirmation shows Trump confidence; dual NSA role demonstrates high trust"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Rubio transformed from 'Little Marco' critic calling Trump 'con artist' in 2016 to loyal SecState. Trump trusts him as 'respectable face' of foreign policy. Rubio more establishment/traditional than inner circle but fully aligned on policy. Dual SecState/NSA role (like Kissinger) shows deep confidence. Relationship is professional-political rather than personal friendship."
      relationship_type: "patron-reformed_critic"

    SecDef_Hegseth:
      score: 0.55
      basis: "Professional cooperation but different styles; Rubio traditional diplomat, Hegseth culture warrior; potential friction on alliances"
      confidence: "medium-high"
      notes: "Rubio more establishment Republican, values alliances and diplomacy. Hegseth anti-establishment, prioritizes military culture wars. Both hawk on China but Rubio emphasizes State Department tools while Hegseth focuses on military readiness. Rubio's demand for NATO 5% GDP aligns with Hegseth but Rubio more diplomatic in approach. Respectful but not natural allies. Rubio's dual NSA role may create turf issues."

    NSA_Position_Rubio_Holds:
      score: 1.0
      basis: "Rubio IS the Acting NSA since May 2025 while remaining SecState"
      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Unprecedented dual role. Rubio holds both SecState and Acting NSA positions simultaneously (like Kissinger 1973-75). Centralizes foreign policy decision-making. Rubio coordinates NSC process, manages interagency, and executes diplomacy. Massive workload but eliminates State-NSC friction."

    VP_Vance:
      score: 0.75
      basis: "Vance swore Rubio in; both align on China threat and America First; generational peers"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Vance administered oath of office to Rubio. Both represent younger generation of MAGA-aligned Republicans. Share China hawk views and skepticism of endless wars. Rubio more experienced/establishment but ideologically aligned. Good working relationship expected."

      basis: "Professional military-civilian relationship; Caine's CIA background aligns with Rubio's intelligence committee experience"
      confidence: "medium"
      notes: "Rubio was Vice Chair of Senate Intelligence Committee; Caine came from CIA. Shared intelligence community background. Both focus on China threat. Rubio values military input more than pure Trumpists. Professional respect expected though no prior close relationship."

      basis: "Bipartisan PPP work; unanimous confirmation; but partisan on many issues"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "Democrats supported Rubio 99-0 for confirmation - rare in polarized era. PPP during COVID showed bipartisan capacity. However, hawk positions on Cuba, Venezuela, Iran create friction with progressives. Respected but not aligned."

      basis: "Values alliances more than Trump/Hegseth but demands burden-sharing; traditional Republican approach"
      confidence: "high"
      notes: "European allies more comfortable with Rubio than Hegseth. Rubio understands alliance value and speaks their language. But demands 5% GDP spending and burden-sharing. More diplomatic than Hegseth but still transactional. Will maintain relationships while pressuring."

      notes: "China views Rubio as major threat. He's on Chinese sanctions list. Authored Uyghur Forced Labor Act. Consistent China hawk for decade+. Relationship is adversarial competition. Will engage on narrow issues (climate) but fundamentally hostile."

      confidence: "very_high"
      notes: "Rubio is iconic figure in Cuban-American politics. Community expects maximum pressure on Cuba regime. Any softening would be personally/politically devastating. This constituency drives his Cuba policy red lines."
