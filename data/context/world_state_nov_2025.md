## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The global security environment in November 2025 is characterized by unprecedented instability, with **59 active military conflicts worldwide** — the highest number since World War II. The world faces what analysts term a "polycrisis": multiple interconnected crises that mutually reinforce each other.

### Critical Developments Affecting US National Security:

1. **Iran-Israel Ceasefire (Post-12-Day War)** - Following US/Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 2025), a fragile ceasefire holds but Houthi attacks from Yemen continue.

2. **Ukraine Negotiations Stalled** - Trump administration's 100-day deadline for Russia-Ukraine settlement has passed; Russia delays while advancing in Donbas. US threatening to "move on" from negotiations.

3. **China-Taiwan Tensions Remain High** - Despite new US-China military-to-military channels, PLA continues aggressive South China Sea and Taiwan Strait activities.

4. **NATO Burden-Sharing Revolution** - Alliance agreed to 5% GDP defense spending target by 2035 (up from 2%) under Trump pressure, but internal resistance and financial strain significant.

5. **North Korea Provocation Cycle Resumed** - Kim Jong Un conducting hypersonic missile tests and ICBM engine development; nuclear arsenal expanding to ~50 assembled warheads.

6. **Nuclear Arms Control Collapse** - New START Treaty expires February 2026 with no replacement negotiations; dangerous new arms race emerging among US, Russia, China.

7. **Latin America Military Escalation** - US deployed 10,000 troops on 10 warships to Caribbean; 64 killed in strikes on Venezuelan vessels; regime change objectives emerging.

8. **Sahel Terrorism Crisis** - Region accounts for 51% of global terrorism deaths; Russian Wagner presence expanding as Western forces withdraw.

### US Military Posture (November 2025):

## I. MIDDLE EAST

### A. Iran-Israel Conflict

**Status:** FRAGILE CEASEFIRE (Post-12-Day War)

#### The Iran-Israel War (June 13-25, 2025)
The 12-Day War marked the first direct conventional military conflict between Iran and Israel:

**Timeline:**
- **June 13, 2025:** Israel launched surprise strikes on Iranian military facilities
- **June 15:** Iran retaliated with ballistic missile and drone strikes on Israeli targets
- **June 21:** US joined conflict - **Operation Midnight Hammer** struck three Iranian nuclear facilities:
  - **Fordo** (underground enrichment)
  - **Natanz** (main enrichment complex)
  - **Isfahan** (conversion facility)
- **June 22:** Trump declared "spectacular military success" from Situation Room
- **June 24:** Ceasefire brokered; Israel and US achieved primary objective of setting back Iran nuclear program

**Impact:**
- Iran's nuclear program set back "substantially" per VP Vance; "very long time" before nuclear weapon capability
- ~14 GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs delivered by 7 B-2 stealth bombers
- Tomahawk cruise missiles from submarine hit Isfahan surface infrastructure
- Iran's "Axis of Resistance" further weakened (post-Gaza degradation of proxies)

**Current Threat Assessment:**
- **Nuclear:** Enrichment activities severely disrupted but Iran could rebuild within 2-3 years with determination
- **Proxy Networks:** Hezbollah degraded, Hamas weakened, but Houthis in Yemen remain active
- **Retaliation Risk:** MODERATE - Iran  faces domestic pressure but limited capacity for major response
- **Escalation Risk:** LOW-MODERATE - Ceasefire holding but Houthi wildcardcould provoke Israeli response

#### Gaza Situation

**Status:** LIMITED CEASEFIRE VIOLATED; HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE

- **January 19, 2025:** Temporary ceasefire between Israel-Hamas took effect; hostage exchange began
- **March 2025:** Israel broke ceasefire; resumed airstrikes; months-long blockade of food/aid
- **Current:** Intermittent fighting; Gaza "buried under rubble" per international observers
- **Humanitarian:** Severe food insecurity, medical system collapsed
- **Political:** Hamas leadership degraded but not eliminated; governance vacuum

**US Position:** Support for Israel unwavering; humanitarian aid discussed but limited pressure on Israel to maintain ceasefire

#### Yemen and the Houthis

**Status:** ACTIVE CONFLICT; HOUTHI ATTACKS CONTINUING

- Houthis continue targeting ships in Red Sea despite post-Gaza ceasefire

- Israeli DefMin Katz warned Houthis will "learn the hard way"
- **US Involvement:** Participated in March 2025 Yemen strikes (Vance opposed in Signal chat; Miller overrode)

**Threat Assessment:**
- **Red Sea Shipping:** Attacks reduced but ongoing; insurance costs elevated
- **Saudi Arabia:** Wary of Houthi attacks but focusing on economic development
- **Escalation Risk:** MODERATE - Israel may launch larger operation if Houthi attacks intensify

#### Syria

**Status:** ASSAD REGIME TOPPLED; ISLAMIST REBELS IN POWER (Late 2024)

- Assad family's half-century dictatorship ended by Islamist rebel offensive (late 2024)
- Russian and Iranian influence collapsed

## III. EUROPE

### A. Russia-Ukraine War

**Status:** ACTIVE COMBAT; CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS STALLED

#### Military Situation (November 2025)
- **Frontline:** Largely frozen with slow Russian advances in Donbas
- **Russian Control:** Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk (partial), Zaporizhzhia (partial), Kherson (partial)
- **Ukrainian Counteroffensive:** Stalled; limited gains
- **Kursk Incursion:** Russia recaptured most territory Ukraine seized in 2024
- **Attrition:** Both sides suffering heavy casualties; equipment losses severe

#### Trump Administration Ceasefire Efforts

**March 2025 - Jeddah Talks:**
- Ukraine agreed to immediate 30-day ceasefire if Russia accepts
- US resumed intelligence sharing and security assistance to Ukraine
- Ceasefire would halt all hostilities along entire front line

**US Proposal Terms:**
- Full ceasefire and frozen front line
- Ukrainian territory seized by Russia remains under Moscow control
- Kyiv's NATO membership ambitions off table
- Prospect of easing sanctions on Russia
- **Recognition of Crimea as Russian**

**Russia's Response:** Delaying, dragging out negotiations
- Putin sees no urgency; Russia making slow gains

- Demands Ukraine never join NATO
- Seeks military limitations on Ukraine
- Wants all sanctions lifted

**Ukraine's Position:**
- Desperate for Western support

- **Rubio:** "It's not our war"
- Trump's 100-day deadline passed with no deal
- US may "move on" from Ukraine peace efforts

**Outlook:**
- **Ceasefire Likelihood:** MODERATE - some agreement may emerge but will be truce, not peace
- **Territorial Reality:** Ukraine likely must accept significant losses
- **NATO Question:** Membership off table for foreseeable future
- **Russian Consolidation:** Moscow will fortify occupied territories

#### European Response
- Europe recognizes it may need to support Ukraine without US
- **NATO 5% Spending:** Partly driven by Ukraine threat
- Defense industrial base ramping up but insufficient to replace US aid
- Poland, Baltics, Nordics most committed to Ukraine support

---

### B. NATO Alliance

**Status:** STRAINED BUT HOLDING; BURDEN-SHARING REVOLUTION UNDERWAY

#### The 5% Defense Spending Pledge (June 2025 Summit)

**Historic Shift:**
- NATO allies agreed to **5% of GDP on defense by 2035** (up from 2% guideline)
- Breakdown: **3.5% "core" defense** (weapons, personnel) + **1.5% defense-related** (infrastructure)
- Most significant alliance policy shift in a decade

**Implementation Reality:**
- **Only Estonia and Lithuania** have pledged to meet 5% immediately
- **Spain negotiated opt-out**
- **Slovakia called targets "absurd"**
- Most allies struggling with how to finance

**Financial Impact:**
- Could add ~$2 trillion to collective debt of NATO European members by 2035
- Hardest hit: Italy (135% debt/GDP), France (113%), Belgium (105%)
- **Austerity vs. Defense Dilemma:** Social spending cuts required to fund

**Progress on 2% Target:**
- Most NATO members now meet or approach 2% (up from only 3 in 2014)
- Trump pressure has been effective despite controversial rhetoric

**Trump's NATO Threats:**
- Called NATO "obsolete"
- Said he'd let Russia "do whatever the hell" it wants to delinquent allies
- Questioned Article 5 collective defense commitment
- **Vance Munich Speech (Feb 2025):** Told Europeans "threat comes from within," shocked allies

**Alliance Cohesion:**
- **Eastern Europe** (Poland, Baltics, Romania): Strongly committed, increasing spending
- **Western Europe** (Germany, France, Italy): Verbal commitment but financial strain
- **Southern Europe** (Spain, Portugal): Resistant to 5% target
- **Turkey:** Wildcard; Erdogan playing Russia-NATO both sides

**US Commitment Under Trump:**
- Transactional approach: allies must pay or US won't defend
- Traditional Article 5 solidarity questioned
- Burden-sharing paramount
- Miller removed Article 5 language from Trump speech (2017 precedent)

**Threat Assessment:**
- **Russian Attack on NATO:** UNLIKELY - Russia bogged down in Ukraine
- **Article 5 Invocation:** Would test Trump administration's commitment
- **Alliance Fracture:** POSSIBLE if major crisis occurs and US doesn't respond
