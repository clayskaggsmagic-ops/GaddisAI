# Memory System Configuration
# Based on Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior

# Memory storage configuration
storage:
  backend: "chromadb"
  collection_name: "agent_memories"
  embedding_model: "text-embedding-3-small"  # OpenAI embedding model

# Retrieval parameters (weighted scoring)
retrieval:
  top_k: 5  # Number of memories to retrieve per agent

  # Weighting for combined score (should sum to ~1.0)
  relevance_weight: 0.4   # Vector similarity to query
  recency_weight: 0.3     # Time-based decay
  importance_weight: 0.3  # Importance score

# Reflection triggers
reflection:
  observation_threshold: 10  # Generate reflection every N observations
  reflection_importance: 0.95  # Reflections are high importance
  enabled: true  # Set to false to disable reflection generation

# Time decay configuration
decay:
  half_life_days: 7  # Memories decay 50% in importance every N days
  min_recency_score: 0.1  # Minimum recency score (floor)

# Importance scoring
importance:
  use_llm: false  # Use LLM to score importance (set to false to save API costs - uses heuristics instead)
  default_score: 0.5  # Default importance if scoring fails

  # Heuristic importance scores for known patterns
  heuristics:
    presidential_decision: 0.9  # Trump's final decisions
    advisor_recommendation: 0.7  # Advisor recommendations
    reflection: 0.95  # Self-generated reflections
    observation: 0.5  # Generic observations
